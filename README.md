This is my website!!
====================

It is made with node, express, less, handlebars, underscore, sly.js

[See it here](http://www.talldan.com)

Things that I'm considering
------------------------------------------
- Tidying up the way I generate views. It was a bit of an experiment, but isn't nice to edit.
- Adding a slideshow/presentation style thing for the portfolios.
- Adding some fancy canvas visualisations in the background
- Moving more stuff to the client, including templating (maybe look at precompiling templates)
- Email contact form
- Some of the sprites are made using svgs, so why not just use them as svgs.
- Use grunt to minify and compile javascript/css at build time.
- Make the top nav sticky.
- Make a nice visual CV.
- Set up direct deployment to nodejitsu from github
